  The ig.news project is a blog where users can access the content of each post according to their subscription status.
  The blog has a purchase system integrated with STRIPE, and after the user makes the payment, their subscription will be active 
  and ready to view the full content of the entire blog. If the user does not wish to opt for the subscription, he will have 
  limited access to the content of the posts. And all the data needed to verify signatures or user data are saved in the FaunaDB database.
